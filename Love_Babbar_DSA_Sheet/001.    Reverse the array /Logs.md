### Approach:

All approaches are perfectly documentated here in editorial section.

Kindly refer this  https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/reverse-a-string/1


### My Final Approach:

#### Way 1: By changing the input data
Use temporary storage & swap the data iteratively using for loop.

#### Way 2: By not changing the input data
Use storage for output string. Insert data from input into output string, iteratively using for loop.
