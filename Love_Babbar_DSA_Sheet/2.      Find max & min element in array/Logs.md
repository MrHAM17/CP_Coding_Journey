### Approach:

All approaches are perfectly documentated here. Kindly refer this  https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/maximum-and-minimum-in-an-array/


### My Final Approach:

Make 2 variables min & max. Initialize from location 0 & 1. Run the for loop from 3 to n. Compare current element with min & max, and save the minimum & maximum number.
